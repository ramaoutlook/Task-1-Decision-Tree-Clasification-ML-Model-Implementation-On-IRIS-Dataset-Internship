# 🌸 Decision Tree Classification on Iris Dataset

This project is part of a Machine Learning internship task at **CodTech IT Solutions**. It demonstrates the implementation of a **Decision Tree Classifier** to classify Iris flower species using scikit-learn. The Iris dataset is a classic machine learning dataset that includes 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species (`Setosa`, `Versicolor`, and `Virginica`) based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower based on its physical characteristics. Decision Trees offer a visual and intuitive way to make classification decisions, making them ideal for understanding simple datasets.

## 📌 Key Features

- 📁 Used **Iris dataset** directly from `sklearn.datasets`
- 🔍 Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis** including:
  - Dataset shape and structure
  - Descriptive statistics
  - Target value distribution
- 📈 **Data Visualization** using:
  - Pair plots
  - Correlation matrix heatmaps
  - Class distribution bar charts

- 🛠️ Built a **Decision Tree Classifier** using:
  - Train/test split (80/20)
  - Model training using `DecisionTreeClassifier`
  - Evaluation with **accuracy score** and **confusion matrix**
- 🌳 Visualized the decision tree using `plot_tree`

---

## 🚀 Libraries Used

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
